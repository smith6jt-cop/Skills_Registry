  "description": "Debugging and implementing dynamic Markov regime features in RL observations. Triggers: (1) Markov features appear constant in observation heatmaps, (2) uniform priors [0.33, 0.34, 0.33] instead of actual regime probabilities, (3) InferenceObservationBuilder not updating states, (4) HMM regime detection not reflecting market conditions",
